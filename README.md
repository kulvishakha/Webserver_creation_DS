Web Server Creation in Distributed System


This is the programming assignment which I did in Distributed Systems.

Description of the Assignment:

The goal of this programming assignment is to build a functional web server. The web server will be listening for the connections on a socket (bound to a specific port on the host machine).

Details:

I have implemented a HTTP web server program which can support multi-threading also. It accepts and responds to HTTP requests. The Web server will be listening for connection on a socket and the clients will be connecting to this socket and will try to retrieve files from the server. The client sends request to the server and when the connection is established, a timeout of 3 secs is used for keeping the connection alive for 3 secs. The default file is index.html, so if the user do not enter and filename, the default page will be loaded. The port used is 8080. This web server responds with appropriate responses based on the requests provided to it. The different types of responses shown here are 200, 400, 403, 404, 500. The server file is coded using python programming.
